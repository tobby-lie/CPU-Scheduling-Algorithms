Name:  main.cpp
   Main program which will execute all algorithms via 
   functions.

*  Circumstances of programs
*******************************************************

   The program runs successfully.  
   
   The program was developed and tested on Xcode.  It was 
   compiled, run, and tested on gcc 4.8 on csegrid.ucdenver.pvt.

*  How to build and run the program
*******************************************************

1. Uncompress the homework.  The homework file is compressed.  
   To uncompress it use the following commands 
       % tar -xvf Tobby_Lie_Lab3.tar

   Now you should see a directory named homework with the files:
        main.cpp
        makefile
        Readme.txt
	input_file.txt (used to test algorithms)
	test2review.txt	(used to test algorithms)

2. Build the program.

     Change to the directory that contains the file by:
    % cd Tobby_Lie_Lab3

    Compile the program by:
    % make

3. Run the program by:
   % ./lab3

4. Delete the obj files, executables, and core dump by
   % make clean
